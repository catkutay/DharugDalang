<p>This site uses quicktime software to play audio files. Due to a bug in windows, if the Windows Media Player program is used, you will hear all the sound files played at once.
</p><p>
We recommend if you have this problem to open the Windows Media Player program from the 'Start' Menu on the computer and under the 'Tools' menu in Windows Media Player select 'Options'.
</p><p>
Under Options, you select the tab 'File Types'. Then you click on the ticks beside 'MP3 Audio Files (mp3)' and 'Windows audio file (wav)' to remove them. Click 'OK' and close Windows Media Player. This tells this program not to play mp3 and wav files.
